                truth, who are ready to acknowledge that the universe around us
                is infinite and inexplicable to us, who are ready to open
                themselves to a God who created us, and who loves us.

                It is a mystical experience to accept Jesus into your heart.
                Some people’s lives are immediately changed dramatically, some
                people’s lives are more gradually changed, but always there is a
                sense of coming home, a desire to know God more, a sense of
                wanting to please Him and rather oneself. You will want the
                things of the world less and less, and you will want to seek the
                Lord more and more. Please take upon yourself to read the Word
                of God, ask the Lord to lead you to find a bible believing
                fellowship. <br />
                Look for fellowships that have a dispensational view of Bible
                interpretation, and have a pretribulation understanding of the
                return of the Lord Jesus Christ. Read the Word; purchase a bible
                that has study helps within it. The New King James New Scofield
                Edition is recommended. Note in the About Us – Acknowledgments
