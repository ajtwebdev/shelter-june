                This discussion is meant for those who are truly seeking the
                truth, who are ready to acknowledge that the universe around us
                is infinite and inexplicable to us, who are ready to open
                themselves to a God who created us, and who loves us.

                    not anything made that was made. In him was life; and the
                    life was the light of men. John 3:16 For God so loved the
                    world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever
                    believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
                    life. Luke 19:10 For the Son of man is come to seek and to
                    save that which was lost.

                    and are therefore at enmity with God. You and all men are
                    sinners before God, and there is nothing we can do on our

                    Matthew 15:18-20 But those things which proceed out of the
                    mouth come from the heart, and they defile a man. For out of
                    the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,
                    fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies. These are
                    the things which defile a man… Proverbs 14:1 There is a way
                    that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death.
                    Romans 5:9-10 Much more then, having now been justified by
                    His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him. For if
                    when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the
                    death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we
                    shall be saved by His life. Romans 6:24 For the wages of sin
                    is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus
                    Christ our Lord.

                If the Lord is calling you, if you want to be saved from this
                accursed World, you must understand that you are at enmity God,
                you are his enemy and can do nothing earn His favour – yet He
                loves you, and wants you to come to Him. If you want to be saved
                from evil and the certainty of Hell and separation from God
                forever, you must repent of your sins, ask the Lord Jesus Christ
                to forgive your sins. 2 Corinthians 7:10 For godly sorrow
                produces repentance leading to salvation, not to be regretted;
                but the sorrow of the world produces death. Acts 16:31 Believe
                on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.. Romans 10:9
                That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe
                in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be
                saved. John 3:3 Jesus said … Most assuredly, I say to you,
                unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God. Acts
                2:36 Then Peter said to them, Repent and let everyone of you be
                baptised in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins;
                and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. John 3:16 For
                God so love the world that He gave his only begotten son, that
                whosoever in Him should perish but have everlasting life. Romans
                3:10-18 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one.
                There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh
                after God. They are all gone out of the way, they are together
                become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one
                Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have
                used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips: Whose mouth
                is full of cursing and bitterness. Their feet are swift to shed
                blood: Destruction and misery are in their ways: And the way of
                peace have they not known: There is no fear of God before their
                eyes.

              <p>
                When you have received the saving grace of the Lord Jesus, the
                Holy Spirit dwells within you. Ephesians 1:13 And take the
                helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the
                word of God 1 Corinthians 3:16-17 Do you not know that you are
                the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? If
                anyone defiles the temple of God, God will destroy him. For the
                temple of God is holy, which temple you are. <br />
                It is a mystical experience to accept Jesus into your heart.
                Some people’s lives are immediately changed dramatically, some
                people’s lives are more gradually changed, but always there is a
                sense of coming home, a desire to know God more, a sense of
                wanting to please Him and rather oneself. You will want the
                things of the world less and less, and you will want to seek the
                Lord more and more. Please take upon yourself to read the Word
                of God, ask the Lord to lead you to find a bible believing
                fellowship. <br />
                Look for fellowships that have a dispensational view of Bible
                interpretation, and have a pretribulation understanding of the
                return of the Lord Jesus Christ. Read the Word; purchase a bible
                that has study helps within it. The New King James New Scofield
                Edition is recommended. Note in the About Us – Acknowledgments
